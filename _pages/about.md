Hi! I'm Aidan, a PhD Student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I am advised by Dr. David Moeller and broadly interested in the evolutionary ecology of plants, especially _Clarkia_ and ferns. You can find our lab website [here](https://moellerlab.wordpress.com/). 

My work and research
======
I study ecological genomics, mating systems, and trait evolution, typically in the contexts of incipient speciation, sympatry, and polyploidy.  

Background
======
I recieved my B.A. in Biology with High Honors from Colgate University in 2021. At Colgate, I worked in the plant physiological ecology lab of Dr. James Watkins, focusing in particular on fern gametophyte ecophysiology and reproductive biology.
