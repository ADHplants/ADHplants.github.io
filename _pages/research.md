Polyploidy
======
Whole genome duplication is common across many forms of life, especially plants. The formation of polyploid plants through WGD is implicated in at least 15% of angiosperm speciation events (and 30% in ferns) and is thought to occur at the base of the entire flowering plant lineage. The prevalence of polyploid speciation events around periods of dramatic climatic changes have led to the hypothesis that polyploids are uniquely capable of rapidly adapting to new environments. However, most evidence for physiological and ecolgoical differences between polyploids and diploids originates from observational studies of natural autopolyploids, which have undergone countless generations of natural selection, and mostly ignores allopolyploids due to their often uncertain parentage. Thus, the actual contribution of polyploidy to novel ecological traits seperate from other processes, including natural selection and hybridization, remains unclear.
